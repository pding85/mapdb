MapDB combines embedded database engine and Java collections.
It is free under Apache 2 license. MapDB is fplexible and can be used in many roles:

* Drop-in replacement for Maps, Lists, Queues and other collections.
* Off-heap collections not affected by Garbage Collector
* Multilevel cache with expiration and disk overflow.
* RDBMs replacement with  transactions, MVCC, incremental backups etcâ€¦
* Local data processing and filtering. MapDB has utilities to process huge quantities of data in reasonable time.
